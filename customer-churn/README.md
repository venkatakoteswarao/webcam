<h1 align='center'> Customer Churn Prediction </h1>
<h2 align='center'> Predict if a customer will churn or not using Machine learning </h2>


In this repository, we have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model, and lately, have deployed the model using `flask` and `heroku`.

</p>

----------------------------

## Approach : 

* Performed some data cleaning and feature engineering on raw data. 
* Selected 6 best features to deploy. 
* fitted multiple classification model and finally selected the stacked classification model.
* Saved the model in a `.pkl` file and.
* Later used the same model in the `flask app` and for frontend used `HTML, CSS` and `Bootstrap`.
* Deployed the whole project on ``Heroku` and used `Google Analytics` for tracking users.
------------------------------

## How to run? 

> To run the app you need to download this repository along with the required libraries. and you have to the `app.py` file. 

> after running `app.py` open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
